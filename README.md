# River-Crossing

Rivercrossing is a python based game done mainly by [Ådne](https://github.com/javell) in a school project in 2016(IS-105).
Ådne has done most of the work on the actual game. The mission in this game is to get all animals over the lake without them eating eachother.
I have mainly made the UDP server which allows two users to work together to complete the mission of the game.
Music and graphics is done by Ådne.
